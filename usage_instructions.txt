Upload files or provide website URLs, then use OpenAI's model to ask questions about the content.

## Features

- **OpenAI API Key**: Input in the sidebar. Necessary for the app to function.
- **File Uploader**: Supports `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt`. Images get captioned; documents get text extracted.

- **Chat Interface**: Ask questions about the uploaded or transcribed content.

## Nuances

- Refresh the browser to reset the session if uploading more files after initial upload.
- When multiple files are uploaded, if asking about information found in a particular file, be specific with the filename. 
- Either upload files or insert Website URL, not both.
- Document Similarity Search results cannot be viewed for previous answers.

2. **Upload/URL**: Use the sidebar uploader or input a website URL.
3. **Ask Questions**: Use the chat interface.
