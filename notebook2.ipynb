It is a task that requires you to push a new feature within a brand-new architecture you have never touched on. On the first day, you look through all the documentation on the Confluence page to get more clarification about the feature you are trying to develop. You quickly realize that you won’t even have time to touch on the codebase — understanding the new architecture and the product definition takes up your entire day.However, you know that there will be a status update tomorrow morning. You will need to update your “status” to the team and, more importantly, your manager about how you have progressed through the task.When it comes to your turn on the status update the next day, and the day after that, you give this update to your manager, “I am working on Ticket #123, and no blockers.”That feeling of telling the team that you are still working on the ticket every day without any blockers doesn’t feel impressive — it sounds like you were in the same spot as yesterday. Your manager may start to doubt your competency as a software engineer.You know that you are working towards the task, and it takes time to do more research to develop this feature. However, the long hours of effort that you put in are not acknowledged by the team.You start to dread every status update when you haven’t published any PR or documentation.Let’s face it.Some engineers think that status updates are useless. Others think that status updates can be daunting.However, a status update is a useful session for engineering managers and product managers to understand how everyone is handling their tasks and an opportunity for engineers to showcase their leadership abilities.A status update is where you can showcase how well you manage ambiguity and is an important way to build trust with your team.----15FollowWritten by Edward Huang3K Followers·Writer for Better ProgrammingDocument my journey in technology, functional programming, and careers in tech.
